## Motivation

I built this to be used when quickly prototyping something and using other websites for inspiration. Having a color picker to quickly get tailwind colors from other sites helps me move quicker.

## How to use it locally

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/Nutlope/tailwind-color-picker`.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`, enable developer mode at the top right, click "Load Unpacked", then select the dist folder.
3. Run 'CMD + Shift + X' to toggle the extension, or click it from the toolbar to activate it

## How to install

Coming soon to the chrome extension store!

## Tasks

- [x] Get initial version working for regular color picker
- [x] Get it to show up on all sites and zoom appropriately
- [x] Add tailwind logic to choose closest color
- [x] Working v1!
- [x] Migrate to manifest v3
- [x] Add keyboard shortcut that automatically opens and closes extension
- [ ] Publish to the chrome store [in-progress]
- [ ] Make the color picker close after one select
